Rachna…A Hindi word that fundamentally means &#34;Creation!&#34; </p>
<p class="lot-text">Let us figure out below, what all the Creation aka Rachna loves about herself.</p>
<p class="lot-text">This one is for the girl with the most sincere and honest smile.</p>
<div class="post-body-list-container"><ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
Loving yourself is an art and I love myself in various ways, one of which is reminding myself how grateful I am to be alive, enjoying my life with the one I love the most and can live another infinity years with him.</li><!--more--><br/>
<li>
I realized soon it is important to love self because, I heard someone said that once;”if you cannot love yourself, it is difficult to imagine how you can love others.” Love yourself the most and you will start loving everything around  you or at least make an effort to make everything lovable. So I love almost everything about myself, Head to Toe!</li><br/>
<li>
I love my smile. It can make everyone feel comfortable and welcomed.</li><br/>

<li>
I truly admire another thing in me, which is that I can forgive quickly and love easily. Most people find forgiveness as the most difficult thing to do, but I can.</li><br/>

<a href="/self-love/contest-sahil-verma.html" >Sahil’s</a> note – I felt an immediate liking towards Rachna, the first day of our NLP class. Some people are magnetic that ways. She came across as a successful and self-made female, who at the same time was very humble and open to learn. Eventually, as I started getting to know her more, she revealed a part of her existence that was just so pristine. Maybe it was me, or I don’t know, but I felt, Rachna was just too willing to trust. The way she would let me practice weird NLP patterns on her…she would often close her eyes like a little girl and would TRUST that I will help her in some way or the other. The trust she showed in me, made me become better. When someone so angelic chooses to invest their trust in you, you sort of strive to become the best version of yourself. You give in your best, and then some more, because you know this one person deserves far more than being disappointed.</li></ol></div><br/>

<p class="lot-text">
So thank you, Rachna, for bringing that out of me. And of course, I had to tag you in this self love challenge. And I knew at the beginning of it, that you might take time, but you would definitely do it. I hope it was another enriching experience for you.</p>
<p class="lot-text"><a href="/" >Leanontree’s note</a></b> – It is heartening how friends help friends to love themselves. Thank you, Rachna, for allowing yourself to experience this. And also, for sharing the beautiful experience with all of us. You have definitely brought more beauty and innocence to Leanontree’s humble abode!</p>
