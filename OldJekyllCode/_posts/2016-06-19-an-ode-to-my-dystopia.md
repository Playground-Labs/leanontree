description: While the life happens, someone discovers about what's happening to her
  might not be just her one-off story. It just might be a constant state of hysteria
  since childhood for the ones born with a vagina.

Stay, because I heard it somewhere,<br/>
Stay, because it sounded shinier<br/>
Stay, because someone looked at me<br/>
Stay, as it was supposed to be better<br/>
Stay....

<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Freeze, because I am not better<br/>
Freeze, because I am more of the matter<br/>
Freeze, because I think I should be fixed<br/>
Freeze, as I fail to speak<!--more-->

<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Freeze, because I am scared to move<br/>
Freeze, so as to avoid ripples<br/>
Freeze, because the words weigh me down<br/>
Freeze, so I can drown
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Freeze, because don't be a mother<br/>
Freeze, because you are crazy again<br/>
Freeze, because you are not trying<br/>
Freeze, because you play a victim
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Freeze, because I am burning<br/>
Freeze, because I am being touched<br/>
Freeze, because I am being watched<br/>
Freeze, because I can't trust
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Freeze, because it's mass hysteria<br/>
Freeze, because I have a vagina<br/>
Freeze, because I don't want you to see me cry<br/>
Freeze, because I can feel other's unwillingly
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Like two cold fingers twisting inside my vagina walls, I am not held down. I just freeze.
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Like two cold fingers twisting inside my stagnant mind, I am not held down. I just freeze.
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Like two cold fingers scraping inside my heart, I am not held down. I just freeze.
</p>
<p class="post-text-format-for-traditional-poems">
Like two cold fingers draping my grip, I chop off the dick that threatens me. I am not held down. I don't freeze.
</p>
