<br/>

<li>Posing for photographs. I am highly expressive.</li><br/>
<li> Once a week, I voluntarily cry when I am alone so that all depressive feelings are out of my system along with those tears, and so I can start the next week with a carefree mind. If I don’t feel like crying, I watch an emotional movie and somehow induce tears.</li><br/>
<li>I am very emotional. Tears are ever ready to flow down my face.</li><br/>
<li>I can’t hurt anyone on the face. My feelings of hatred don’t come out that easily.</li><br/>
