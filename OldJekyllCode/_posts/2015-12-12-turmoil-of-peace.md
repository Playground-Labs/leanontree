<p class="lot-text">We bring you the third entry in the My December event, beautifully composed by #twersty. Hereâ€™s an ode to the evanescence of life when viewed against the eternity of winters resting underneath the sheets. Relish in the short-composition, articulating the deserted chaos amidst the December chills.</p><br/>

<p class="post-text-format">December.<br/>
Last chance of digging a grave, to bury my memories.<br/>
Those, which allowed tears, to escape from the airport of abstracts.<br/>
Those, which slid through the valley of slivers of regrets and dumped themselves<!--more-->,<br/>
into the raging ocean of negativity.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">This gloomy quilt stretch wide, covering the layer of fake hopes,<br/>
comforting my spirit to hold the headboard and wait<br/>
for the doorbell of miracle to ring.<br/>
Forced to knuckle under the burden of fur, my closed eyes poke on the eyelids.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">The frustration and the tension, throughout the year,<br/>
pooped out these moods, which are more immature and pigheaded.<br/>
They tie a rope around the cerebellum, and swing along the route of controversies of crap.<br/>
The pithole of miscellany of words, nibbling like a woodpecker on the walls of nightmares,<br/>
armouring the nude seeds of reverie, crimp the illuminated route of time.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">Time?<br/>
An escape from few opportunities, few chances, few choices and few decisions.<br/>
They look at me. Those judgmental eyes, perceive and refuse to explore.<br/>
Smell the change, and ambulate.<br/>
Fears overtake the provisional promises, which stood on the feeble base,<br/>
and garrotte the need of a companion.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">Have I been this alone, since the beginning?
Does this month work as a refinery?</p>

<p class="post-text-format">If yes, then I'm not sailing in Titanic.<br/>
Though, it'll be an annual thing,<br/>
shortening the boundary of life and escalating the number of my dreams.<br/>
But I'll have real fruits in my basket.<br/>
Real and juicy.<br/>
I'm and will be, the only permanent thing in my temporary life.</p><br/>
