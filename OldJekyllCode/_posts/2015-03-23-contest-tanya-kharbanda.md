<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have written about myself from a third person’s point of view , doing so has helped me see a lot of things which I would not be able to see if I wrote it by embodying my own-self.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This may appear to be narcisstic..but I love everything about myself, even the things I don’t like…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>I love "Tanya"</b> completely just way she is flawed and flawless :-)</p>

<li>Lustrous honey hair with natural streaks of gold..(yes its natural, thanks to my genes)</li><!--more--><br/>
