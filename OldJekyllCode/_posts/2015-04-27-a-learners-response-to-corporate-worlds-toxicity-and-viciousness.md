<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Leaner,<br/>Life was going good, and then tough times happened. The way they always do. More than for me, I was sad for the people around me. You know how certain people are like sponges; they sort of absorb the aura and the energies of the place. I am that sponge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so, when the company I work for, decided to make Annual Performance Evaluations as toxic and vicious as humanly possible<!--more-->, I, more than anything else, just wanted my colleagues to feel better. Perhaps to see the light at the end of the tunnel or something like that. Hence, I did what I I could do best..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wrote something!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is for my colleagues.. This for you.. This is for anyone who think people around them are trying to make them less! Here it goes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You're beautiful!" - I am saying this because I am not sure if someone else told it to you today. And you are the sort of person who deserves to know this! You are beautiful!"</p/>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large;">
<b><u>Flowers, and NOT Soap Dishes</u></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
Listen up! Wait. Just be. Stay!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You. Each one of you, are beautiful...wonderful,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Unique in your own way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
So what if they don’t want to see it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<i><b>So what if they find it convenient to ignore?</b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You are beautiful, like the dirt, the pebbles, the flowers blooming in the cracks...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
The skies and the life underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You may are pressured into thinking you are average,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
But let me tell you, my friend, you are more!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You are <b>not a chapter</b> that gets over...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>You are a river</b> that continues to flow...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You are not just a natural resource...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You are the beautiful embodiment of nature and all of its glory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I know you are exhausted...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
The beauty always has to strive for existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
But the existence depends on you, my friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>You are the Source!</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
So let it all tousle, trip and turn...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You can now exist peacefully at the center of the chaos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You are braver than you think...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>You are NOT a victim, but a CREATOR!</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
So <b>find now</b>, as you remain <i>still at your center</i>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>Your own melody</b>...<b>the rhythm of your soul</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Dance or act, sing or cook...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Do what the center tells you to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
The world <b>is</b> faulty, flawed and false...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
And that is why you exist, my friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
To cause the ache. To break it all down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
To let the real life tucked inside you, <b>radiate out!</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Just because the passersby didn't halt to take notice,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>Should the flower cease to bloom?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
No my friend, no!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Because passersby are meant to pass us by; <b>let them!</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You <b>continue to bloom</b>; my love!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Because flowers, are meant to bloom!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Each unique. Each co-existing. Each blooming.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You see now, oh friend...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>We’re flowers...not soap dishes!</b></p>

Is it one of the verses on self-worth? I don't know. I really had no idea that the annual Employee Performance Review at office, would impregnate me with this motivational or whatever poem. I simply just wanted to make my colleagues (and self) feel better. I wonder if it would bring about any change. I wonder if the management would <i>choose now</i> to treat us all as unique flowers, and not just soap dishes. But I hope, Hope, HOPE my colleagues and friends, and you, Dear Leaner, read this, and for a few moments, <b>discover that everlasting peace</b> resting within you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Much love and Power to You!</b></p>
