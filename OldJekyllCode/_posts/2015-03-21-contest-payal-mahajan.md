<p style="text-align: justify;">I accepted this challenge thinking it would be fun, and then I just forgot about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But when I saw <a href="/self-love/contest-sahil-verma.html">Sahil's post</a> I realized that I need to do this...if I say I will, then I will. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here are the 50 things :)</p>
<div class="post-body-list-container"><ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><p>I love the fact that I am a very resilient person.</p> I may cry my heart out, I may scream and shout about the injustices I face, but I will eventually bounce back and overcome most things that life throws at me.</li>
<br />
<li>I love easily. I have been hurt loads of times by people I have loved, but I never seem to learn :).<!--more--> I like the fact that every time I love someone , I do it like I have never been hurt before, with all my heart and soul</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>I trust easily and like a child . I trust completely unless you give me a reason not to..</li>
<br />
<li>I have a child like, wide eyed, curiosity &nbsp;in me. I love to experience new things, get to know new people. It opens my horizons</li>
<br />
<li>I don't carry grudges for long. Someone has to really put in loads of efforts, for me to hate them. I think its a waste of my emotions</li>
<br />
<li>I genuinely am a happy person. It takes a lot to get me down and out.</li>
<br />
<li>I always like to try something at least once, unless I think it would harm me or my loved ones.</li>
<br />
<li>I laugh easily. Mostly I have a naughty smile on my lips.</li>
<br />
<li>I never forget a kindness someone has shown me, specially in my bad times. I will loyally watch such people's back all my life. But at the same time, I don't forget the unkindness too. I may forgive but I don't forget</li>
<br />
<li>I believe that I am a compassionate person. I cannot see others in pain, and will go out of my way to help.</li>
<br />
<li>I am a very loyal person. I make friends for life. If you are my friend, I will hound you till my last breath. I will stand with you no matter what. I will vehemently defend you to the whole world. I will find the reason behind any wrongful action of yours and make sure you understand it. I am a pretty scary friend to have around :)</li>
<br />
<li>I love the fact that I can talk for hours . I love a good conversation. I love interacting with people who stimulate my mind. And I think I have decent conversation skills myself</li>
<br />
<li>I love the fact that I cry easily . I used to hate it before but now I believe it helps me vent out my frustration and makes me stronger. Only strong people can cry..</li>
<br />
<li>I love the fact that I enjoy books. They open my mind, they transport me to a different world . I adore books.</li>
<br />
<li>I believe in magic. I honestly truly believe that there is magic all around us. I believe in the power of positive thoughts and good wishes..</li>
<br />
<li>I love the fact that I am not cynical at all. I believe that there is some good in everybody. Sometimes circumstances make people behave in a cruel fashion but most people aren't really like that</li>
<br />
<li>I love fairy tales, I believe in the happily ever after. I am pretty dreamy eyed :)</li>

<br/>
<li>Even though I am a dreamy person, but when it comes to day-today life I am very practical. I have a firm grip on my work and my home affairs , and I manage them pretty well.</li>
<br /><li> I am pretty adventurous . I love the adrenaline rush that I get from the unknown and the dangerous :)</li>
<br /><li>I can be pretty patient with people I love and it takes a lot of dumbness to actually provoke me.</li>
<br /><li>I like that I am becoming less and less judgmental as I am growing up. I have faced a lot of judgement myself , and I have taken a firm decision to not force that on to others.</li>
<br /><li>I like my eyes. I love the way they sparkle and how full of life they are. I love the emotions they express.</li>
<br /><li>I love my smile. I think it lights up the room and brightens my world.</li>
<br /><li>I love my crazily expressive face with has a thousand expressions on it. And I love the way those expressions make the people break into a smile :)</li>
<br /><li>I love my hands. They are all soft and chubby, like they haven't done one day of hard work . Which by the way is not true :)</li>
<br /><li>I have learned to love the stretch marks on my body. They are a proof of battles won, of harder days which I didn't succumb to.</li>

<br /><li>I have learned to love my size and shape after years of criticism and disapproval.</li>
<br /><li>I like my hairstyle right now. I think it suits my face :)</li>
<br /><li>I think I am blessed with good skin. I owe it to my mom</li>
<br /><li>I like the fact that I love children. They represent hope and innocence to me. I think I will be an awesome mom one day :)</li>
<br /><li>I love the fact that my work matters to me a lot. If my patients are in pain, I would worry about them,till they are fine. The fact that I care about my work, makes me a better dentist</li>
<br /><li>I like the fact that I have faith. Whether it is in God, or in some universal energy, I genuinely believe that someone out there is looking out for me</li>
<br /><li>I have started believing in guardian angels. I think my dad is my angel , looking after me and making sure that I am alright . He guides me to the right path, when I feel most alone..</li>
<br /><li>I like that I have learned to shed tears without feeling broken inside. I have learned to shed happy tears. Tears of remembrance with a smile on my face..</li>
<br /><li>I like that I listen to people's advice. There are very few people whose advice I really follow, but when they say something I take it very seriously . Even if I don't agree with it, I listen to their side of the argument and more often then not I can see what I did wrong. I cherish such people in my life.</li>
<br /><li>I love the fact that I am learning to live on my own terms, without worrying about what people would think of me.&nbsp;</li>

<li>I love the fact that I am very dependable . If I said I would be there, I will. I will watch your back and not back out.</li>
<br /><li>I don't go back on my words. If I said I will do it, I will do it. Don't push me. I will do it in my own time, but I will.</li>
<br /><li>I mostly don't lie. Unless they are fun, stupid harmless things . I would rather not say anything , then lie.&nbsp;</li>

<br /><li>I think I am very witty. I admire people who can outwit me</li>
<br /><li>I love the fact that I can be pretty lazy sometimes . I can just be like a log, not even moving from the bed. It helps me unwind</li>
<br /><li>I love the fact that I have understood that nobody in this world is indispensable. I know that I can live without absolutely anybody. It may be very painful, but I won't die.Somebody recently told me something, which I won't ever forget.He said that "we will loose all the people we love to death, either theirs or ours." I have made this the Motto of my life. I am learning to detach myself...

<br /><li>I am a very intelligent person. Sometimes I wish I was more hardworking, but I guess am getting there..</li>
<br /><li>I love the fact that I can jog 6km without stopping. I never thought that I could achieve that</li>
<br /><li>I am very protective and caring person for my family and friends. I won't let harm come to them. I would destroy anyone who tries to hurt them.</li>
<br /><li>I love the fact that I can do good makeup . It brightens up my sad days. It makes me look prettier on days I don't feel pretty at all..</li></ol></div>
