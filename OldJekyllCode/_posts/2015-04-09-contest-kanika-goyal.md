She is one of the first people to accept this challenge from our side, and went on to challenge several of her friends to do this. Because she knows what it takes to get this done in this world. Personally, she has one of the most reassuring and calming smile I have EVER seen.<!--more--> And you know what, she can cook! Oh man, she can cook.
