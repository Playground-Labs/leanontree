ASHA – Adult Survivors Healing Association against Child Sexual Abuse is your safe space. We have created this space for people who have survived Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and their friends, family, partners or other allies. At ASHA, we are your fellow survivors who aim to create a strong support system and network of adult survivors of CSA.<!--more-->

The inception of the group began from our sincere quest to find and connect with fellow survivors and bring a different range of experiences under one roof. For long, we have wondered if others like us have an access to any such space that allows for people to share their personal stories and experiences, without necessarily making it a clinical experience. When we failed to discover such a space anywhere around us (families, friends, schools and colleges, partners, etc), we decided to create one instead. And hence, ASHA was born from our deepest desire to access a space that is harboured around one’s visceral experiences CSA and connect with other adult survivors.

At ASHA meet-ups, we would be facilitating conversations around one’s personal experiences with CSA. We would be covering various facets pertaining to adult survivors, including and not limited to their mental health, emotional well-being, social or romantic lives, and more. 
 
Come, and be a part of it. You may sit in the corner (it’s okay, we have been there too!) or choose to tell your story (if not in its entirety, then maybe a chapter at a meet-up). Promise, we’ll be patient and understanding.

**Kindly support our initiative!**
