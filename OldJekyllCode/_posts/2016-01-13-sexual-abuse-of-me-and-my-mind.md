<p class="post-text-format">My blood boils. You think it will evaporate, leaving me dead and pale after all the irregular menstruation every month, but no. I exist. I still feel the anger in multi folds that I used to. Even after almost a decade now. Wow! About ten years. And it still feels like yesterday.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">My earliest memory of my sexual abuse is my first cousin feeling my per-pubescent chest and remarking that I don't have any breast.<!--more--> His hands felt cold I think. I have a feeling that they were cold. That filled me with a feeling of not being 'enough'.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">I was at my home. A place till date marked as 'Safe' by my parents.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">My mother and aunts (his mother too) used to leave us children at home to go shopping. Our favourite pass time was to play hide n seek by making the house dimly lit. He used to keep me with him at most times. Touching me when in dark corners or when no one was looking.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">There is a long tale that follows on similar path from here. For the next ten years I was this person. The next 6 years now I have spent not to be that person. Spiraling and screaming in every direction. There is a monologue running through my mind 24x7 now. I am successful in silencing that when I am busy with work. Because what I fear is that I will come closer to my reality if I start giving into the monologue.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">I am writing this. I always knew I would start writing this one day. I didn't plan this and I am thankful for that. Because I am certain now that more will follow after this.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">The Childhood Was Lost. Again and again.</p>
