<p class="post-text-format">Winter brings out the best in her,<br/>
She becomes demanding as a queen,<br/>
And I, her humble slave,<br/>
Bow down to her whims,</p>

<p class="post-text-format">She has me chained and bound.<br/>
The cold winter seems warm against her heart.<br/>
She scratches and bites.<br/>
Yet how she delights!</p><!--more-->

<p class="post-text-format">There is love in the dark chilly afternoon winds,<br/>
Dividing my heart in a million little things.<br/>
Oh the faint shadowy sun,<br/>
Watching helplessly over her lovely countenance.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">His grandeur, his might no longer a lure,<br/>
For what ails my beloved...has and will have no cure.<br/>
The cold wind has unclothed her.<br/>
Naked she stands in the cold.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">What beauty, such dignity, no eye can behold.<br/>
All science be damned, in the cold she expands.<br/>
A blooming balloon, making me dance,<br/>
Like the sea to the moon, bewitched by her charms.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">How I crave for those arms, those places those streets,<br/>
Where I trundled and crawled, with my baby feet.<br/>
Where I stumbled in my youth, to be rescued by her.<br/>
 Those grand monuments of love, so pure in the veil of thin mist.<br/>
Huge shadowy trees, touching the skies- white at day and red in the night.<br/>
Tall buildings, small slums,<br/>
The people infinite, their heads on her thighs,<br/>
All breaths from her sighs.</p>


<p class="post-text-format">Enchanted, we all love her,
Against logic, we endeavor to claim her.
But who can ever tame her?
One sweep of her gaze and our lives are consumed.</p>

<p class="post-text-format">The serenity of snow we do not deserve...
Ours is the grey cold winter...
With harsh, slashing rain....</p>

<p class="post-text-format">Drowning in duality....smiling through pain.</p><br/>
