50 Things I love About Myself, By Punyasloka Parida</h3>
<div class="post-body-list-container"><ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>I am usually kind to people especially strangers.</li>
<li>I learnt to write and read Hindi within one month. Hindi is
neither my mother tongue nor my second language in school until 6th grade. I
could write essays after that!&nbsp;</li>
<li>

I can write, read and speak in three different languages.
There is an additional language that I know only to speak which happens to be
my mother tongue!</li>
<li>
I am good in organic chemistry. During my 12th grade, I used
to spend hours solving chemical equation conversions given that I used to a be
really very poor in chemistry during my early grades.</li><br/>

<br/>
<li>I believe I have a good taste about music in general. I am not into any specific genre but one can always rely on my choice of music.</li><br/>
<li>
Works of A.R. Rahman, John Williams, Thomas Newman and Amit
Trivedi are very close to me. I grew up with it and they fill up my loneliness.</li><br/>
<li>

I am good in trigonometry.</li><br/>
<li><b>I speak very less and observe a lot.</b></li><br/>
<li><b>
I love my ability to talk with myself and analyse a
situation.</b></li><br/>
<li>I like listening to every individual's perspective on the
situation than drawing one myself.</li><br/>
<li>I have an OCD for clean desktop window, neat designs and
clean mail inbox.</li><br/>
<li>I am capable of capturing a particular scene in a beautiful
way inside my mind. I have been trying to do the same with my camera
nowadays.&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>I have a great taste for off-beat cinema. The more it makes
you sleep, the more I love it.</li><br/>
<li><b>I am proud of my love for unconventional cinema.</b></li><br/>
<li>I don't stop talking if the topic is "cinema".</li><br/>
<li><b>I love watching movies in almost empty cinema halls. That
way I can get more intimate with the movie.</b></li><br/>
<li>If I watch a movie in my laptop, I always watch it in
pieces.</li><br/>
<li>If I am moved after watching a war movie, you can say the
movie is really good. Though I have never been to war, I have an emotional
attachment towards war related stories on screen.</li><br/>
<li>I am a big admirer of Anurag Kashyap and some of his movies
are part of my life.</li><br/>
<li><b>I can make people laugh just by describing the obvious things.
I learnt it from stand-up comedy sketches.</b></li>
<br/>

<br/>
<li>I love my formal black shoes. I wear it with almost
everything.</li><br/>
<li>I love wearing metal watches. The touch of metal over skin
feels very good.</li><br/>
<li>I love dressing up in formal attire than in casuals. It kind
of gives me confidence!</li><br/>
<li>I like being natural when it comes to grooming. I love
growing up my beard and hair and look like a vagabond but I groom up too.</li><br/>
<li>I am a good gamer (video games) and an expertise in
SMACKDOWN: HERE COMES THE PAIN. You need to be really good in that to beat me
up.</li><br/>
<li>I love skimming through magazines that feature luxurious
cars, hotels, gadgets. I never read them, just skim.</li><br/>

<br/>
<li>I have a great love for movie posters especially the ones
that are available easily.</li><br/>
<li><b>If something is good but ignored, criticized or hated, I
start loving it even more. </b>&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>I love my geeky glasses. No matter how much people criticize
it, I love them.</li><br/>
<li>I love coding, designing and understanding algorithms for
simple tasks.&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>If I get stuck while fixing a bug, I become crazy and
restless.&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>I have never succeeded on focusing on anything else till I
fix the bug.</li><br/>
<li>I love writing computer programs to automate tasks that I do
on daily basis in my computer.&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>Sometimes, I browse a website just to look at its design -
"<b>the look and feel</b>."</li><br/>
<li>I was told to attend a sample aptitude/technical exam once
and I wrote it in a very casual way. When the results were declared, I got a
good score and that became my passport to attend job interview despite my
backlog after an year.&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>I love my phone very much because it was made by a company
which loved mobile devices more than the money it made.</li><br/>
<li><b>I love sitting alone in the back seat of a car and I prefer
remaining silent during a car drive.</b></li><br/>
<li>I love sleeping on bench than on bed. It's a habit developed
during my school days and it feels heavenly!</li><br/>
<li>I have started loving clicking photos - the edges of an
object, the focus, the colour and everything candid. </li><br/>
<li>I show a great deal of enthusiasm while editing a photo I love.</li><br/>

<li><b>During college, I used to be the preferred guy for designing
posters.</b></li><br/>
<li>I consume a lot of time to design a simple poster but I try
to make sure that every pixel is original.</li><br/>
<li>I show the same enthusiasm for videos as well. Editing clips
and mixing audio to them are my favourite.</li><br/>
<li>I especially love creating non-linear storyline for the
videos I edit.</li><br/>
<li>When it comes to creating title and end credits, I take way
more time to finish them than the video itself as I love it so much!</li><br/>
<li>I only torrent movies which are available in Blue-Ray or
High Definition Format. I delay &nbsp;watching a movie for months just to wait
for the blue-ray version to be released by the torrent websites.</li><br/>
<li><b>My only contribution to anti-piracy is to watch movies at
movie theatre. Especially the ones which doesn't have much audience because of
its unconventional subject. </b></li><br/>
<li>I prefer hearing a movie soundtrack than standalone albums.</li><br/>
<li>I love scribbling on walls with my foot nails. You can see
my masterpiece in my bedroom at home.<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></li><br/>
<li>I love listening to Old Hindi songs in All India Radio especially when there is no electricity supply along with mad rain.</li><br/>
